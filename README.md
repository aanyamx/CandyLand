Java, JavaScript, JFrame, JFreeChart, Visual Studio Code, Clip Studio Paint

## Class Structure

frame.java: Main method
 - Board.java: Draws background and creates other classes
    - Player.java: handles backend functionality. Prompts user to input a topic, uses the OpenAI API to generate trivia questions, verifies user answers, and builds a HashMap to store questions with a key that indicated whether they were answered correctly or incorrectly
        - EndScreen.java: Generates and displays a progress report
        - Bargraph.java: Displays a bargraph using general topics generated by the OpenAI API on the questions asked and helps users visually reflect on their understanding. Uses the JFreeChart Library
- WelcomeScreen.java: Draws welcome screen and takes starting input from the user


## Core Functionalities
AI Integration: The application utilizes the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model to generate custom trivia questions and validate user responses in real-time.
Navigation: Movement is controlled via keyboard input, with the game automatically pausing at specific "landmarks" to trigger a trivia challenge.
Customizable Themes: Users can input any topic at the start of the game, and the backend will generate relevant questions accordingly.
Data Reporting: At the end of the game, an EndScreen displays a comprehensive table of questions asked, user answers, and the correct answers.
Statistical Visualization: The game uses JFreeChart to produce a bar graph analyzing user accuracy across different sub-topics within the chosen theme.


## Key Algorithms

Side-Scrolling: This game uses a side-scrolling illusion where the character remains stationary and the board moves backwards. There are two key variables:
    - Nx2: tracks current position on the board
    - Dx: distance the board moves on each refresh/frame
Nx2 is updated by subtracting Dx on each refresh. When Nx2 % checkpointValue == 0, the game knows it has reached a specific point and prompts the user with the next question

Processing User Input: This game has four key steps to processing user input. It asks the user what they want to learn, then generates ten questions on this topic using the OpenAI API, then generates answers for these questions, and finally, calls back to the OpenAI API to check if the user answer is similar enough

## Setup and Installation
**Prerequisites**
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
External Libraries:
 - org.json for parsing API responses
 - JFreeChart and JCommon for BarGraph
**API Configuration**
 - To enable question generation, you must provide your own OpenAI API key in Player.java:
 - con.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");

## Gameplay Instructions
 - Enter your name and preferred trivia topic in the WelcomeScreen.
 - Use the Right Arrow Key to advance the side-scroller.
 - When prompted, type your answer into the answerField and select Submit.
 - After eight questions, the system will generate a final report and performance graph.
