# CandyLand
A Java implementation of a CandyLand-themed side-scroll game that quizzes users on any topic of their choice with questions generated by the OpenAI API
Built as the final project for AP Computer Science A - June 2023
Created by Aanya Mishra, Sriya Sthanikam, and Ahana Mangla

**Languages/Libraries/Developer Tools Used**

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, JPanel, JFrame, JFreeChart, Visual Studio Code, Clip Studio Paint

**Class Structure**

frame.java: Main method
 - Board.java: Draws background and creates other classes
    - Player.java: handles backend functionality. Prompts user to input a topic, uses the OpenAI API to generate trivia questions, verifies user answers, and builds a HashMap to store questions with a key that indicated whether they were answered correctly or incorrectly
        - EndScreen.java: Generates and displays a progress report
        - Bargraph.java: Displays a bargraph using general topics generated by the OpenAI API on the questions asked and helps users visually reflect on their understanding. Uses the JFreeChart Library
- WelcomeScreen.java: Draws welcome screen and takes starting input from the user

**Key Algorithms**

Side-Scrolling: This game uses a side-scrolling illusion where the character remains stationary and the board moves backwards. There are two key variables:
    - Nx2: tracks current position on the board
    - Dx: distance the board moves on each refresh/frame
Nx2 is updated by subtracting Dx on each refresh. When Nx2 % checkpointValue == 0, the game knows it has reached a specific point and prompts the user with the next question

Processing User Input: This game has four key steps to processing user input. It asks the user what they want to learn, then generates ten questions on this topic using the OpenAI API, then generates answers for these questions, and finally, calls back to the OpenAI API to check if the user answer is similar enough
